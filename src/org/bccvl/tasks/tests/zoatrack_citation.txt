Title: Satellite telemetry and seasonal movements of Magpie Geese (Anseranas semipalmata) in tropical northern Australia
Description: We tracked the seasonal movements of 10 Magpie Geese in tropical northern Australia, predominantly within Kakadu National Park, using ARGOS satellite telemetry. Movements were multi-directional and the maximum linear distance travelled by an individual was 114 km from the site of release, over 38 weeks of tracking. Movements did appear to be related to seasonal environmental fluctuations, with some birds moving to favoured breeding and foraging sites, but most monitored birds were resident within the national park. No accurate data were obtained beyond 12 months, with most birds apparently losing their telemeters within 6 months. Just 62% of point-location data were accurate to within 1000 m.
Species Scientific Name: Anseranas semipalmata
Species Common Name: Black And White Goose, Magpie Goose, Magpie-goose, Pied Goose, Semipalmated Goose, Wild Goose
Licencing and Ethics Clearance: Animal ethics was approved through the University of Adelaide (S-050- 2007). The project was listed with the Australian Bird and Bat Banding Scheme (project number 1456).
